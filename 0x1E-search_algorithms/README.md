## Algorithms Included
The repository currently includes the following search algorithms:

1. **Linear Search**: A simple algorithm that searches for a target element by checking each element in a list or array sequentially.

2. **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm for finding a target element in a sorted list or array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

3. **Jump Search**: A search algorithm that works by dividing the data into smaller blocks and performing linear search on these blocks.

4. **Interpolation Search**: A search algorithm that estimates the position of the target element by assuming a uniform distribution of data and then performs binary search.

5. **Exponential Search**: A search algorithm that involves finding a range in which the target element lies and then performing binary search within that range.

6. **Fibonacci Search**: A search algorithm that uses the Fibonacci sequence to determine the search range and perform binary search.

## Installation
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x1E-search_algorithms.git
   ```

2. Change your current directory to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd 0x1E-search_algorithms
   ```

3. The repository does not have any external dependencies, so you can run the scripts directly in a Python environment.

## Usage
Each search algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script within the repository. You can run these scripts independently to test the algorithms. Here is a general usage pattern:

1. Choose the search algorithm you want to test (e.g., `linear_search.py`).

2. Run the script using Python, providing any required inputs as command-line arguments.

Example:
```bash
python linear_search.py --list 5 10 15 20 25 30 --target 15
```

3. The script will output the result of the search, indicating whether the target element was found and its index if applicable.

Feel free to explore the scripts, modify them, or integrate them into your own projects as needed.
